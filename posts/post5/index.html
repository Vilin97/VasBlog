See <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5463862406545408">the project proposal</a> and <a href="/posts/post1">the first post</a> for the proposed work. In short, I contributed spatial simulation algorithms to <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl"><code>DiffEqJump</code></a> – a Julia module for simulating jump processes. Below is a rather detailed description of all the work I have done this summer. Follow the embedded links for more details.</p> <p>Here is a cool-looking simulation I made in 2019 as part of my BA thesis. <style> figure { margin: 0 0 15px 20px; float: center; text-align: center; } </style> <figure> <img src="/assets/dna_diffusion_movie_10fps.gif" width="90%" /> <figcaption> Simulation of the DNA repressor model. </figcaption> </figure> </p> <h2 id=interface_for_spatial_ssas ><a href="#interface_for_spatial_ssas" class=header-anchor >Interface for spatial SSAs</a></h2> <p>Since <code>DiffEqJump</code> did not have spatial solvers before this summer, a new interface had to be developed. It had to be consistent with the existing interface because it feeds into the rich ecosystem of <code>SciML</code>, and be flexible enough for more spatial SSAs to be added. After a lot of trial and error such an interface was settled on. In short, only two extra keyword arguments are required of the user over what is needed for an ordinary non-spatial problem. See <a href="/posts/post4">the previous post</a> or <a href="https://tutorials.sciml.ai/html/jumps/spatial.html">this tutorial</a> for a detailed description of the interface.</p> <p>Apart from the interface that is exposed to the user, an internal interface for spatial SSAs was developed. The most notable elements of it are three <code>struct</code>s that keep track of spatial information needed by any spatial solver: <code>CartesianGrid</code>, <code>RxRates</code> and <code>HopRates</code>.</p> <h2 id=spatial_solvers ><a href="#spatial_solvers" class=header-anchor >Spatial Solvers</a></h2> <p>Two specialized spatial solvers were added to <code>DiffEqJump</code> – <code>NSM</code> and <code>DirectCRDirect</code>. Additionally, a flattening method was added as fallback. See <a href="/posts/post4/index.html#solvers">post 4</a> for a description of the two solvers and flattening. In short, <code>NSM</code> uses a binary heap to choose the next site to fire, resulting in <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=false >(</mo><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=false >)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class=mopen >(</span><span class=mop >lo<span style="margin-right:0.01389em;">g</span></span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class=mclose >)</span></span></span></span> asymptotic runtime – the time to update the heap; <code>DirectCRDirect</code> uses a clever priority table resulting in <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=false >(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=false >)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class=mopen >(</span><span class=mord >1</span><span class=mclose >)</span></span></span></span> runtime but with higher overhead; flattening treats species at different sites as distinct and treats diffusive hops as monomolecular reactions resulting in extremely high memory usage. The asymptotic runtime of flattened algorithms depend on the exact non-spatial SSA used but are not representative of real performance due to inefficient memory use.</p> <p>Both specialized solvers perform better than the two best existing non-spatial solvers – <code>RSSACR</code> and <code>DirectCR</code> as can be seen in the figure below.</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/SSAs_comparison_plot.png" width="120%" /> <figcaption> Comparison of spatial SSAs on a big model </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id=spatial_structs_and_utilities ><a href="#spatial_structs_and_utilities" class=header-anchor >Spatial structs and utilities</a></h2> <p>There are now <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl/tree/master/src/spatial">four files</a> with utility functions and <code>struct</code>s for spatial solvers – <code>utils.jl</code>, <code>topology.jl</code>, <code>hop_rates.jl</code> and <code>reaction_rates.jl</code>. </p> <p>The first one contains functions for doing various routines common to all or many spatial SSAs. For example <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl/blob/master/src/spatial/utils.jl#L59"><code>update_state&#33;</code></a> updates the current state. </p> <p>The second file contains several <code>struct</code>s to keep track of the topology of the system. Most notably, <code>CartesianGrid</code> represents a Cartesian Grid – an interval, a rectangle, or a 3D equivalent of a rectangle &#40;sometimes called hyperrectangle&#41;. See <a href="/posts/post3">post 3</a> for a description of <code>CartesianGrid</code>. Additionally, any graph from <code>LightGraphs</code> can be passed in, allowing for simulations on unstructured meshes. This can be useful in epidemics simulations &#40;representing a geographical region as a graph&#41; and simulations on meshes obtained from triangulating a surface.</p> <p>The last two files implement two analogous <code>struct</code>s – <code>RxRates</code> to keep track of reactions and <code>HopRates</code> to keep track of spatial hops. The latter of the two is specifically optimized for <code>CartesianGrid</code>.</p> <h2 id=tests_tutorials_benchmarks_documentation ><a href="#tests_tutorials_benchmarks_documentation" class=header-anchor >Tests, tutorials, benchmarks, documentation</a></h2> <p>In order to ensure accuracy of the newly added solvers and utility structures <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl/tree/master/test/spatial">three tests</a> have been created. One tests utilities and the other two test the accuracy of the solvers. All three tests are passing.</p> <p>A comprehensive <a href="https://tutorials.sciml.ai/html/jumps/spatial.html">tutorial</a> has been written and added to <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SciMLTutorials.jl"><code>SciMLTutorials</code></a>. This will help users get started with the new functionality.</p> <p>A benchmarking <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBenchmarks.jl/pull/298">script</a> has been written, and will be included in <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBenchmarks.jl"><code>SciMLBenchmarks</code></a>. It uses a model from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op&#61;view_citation&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;user&#61;Tf5L2NIAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view&#61;Tf5L2NIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC">a research paper</a> and compares the performance of the newly added spatial SSAs to the best existing SSAs. The figure above is generated by this script.</p> <p>All functions and structures have docstrings in order to help future developers understand and extend the code.</p> <h2 id=further_work ><a href="#further_work" class=header-anchor >Further work</a></h2> <p>This <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl/issues/189">issue</a> on Github contains the roadmap of what has been done and what is left to do in the future.
