# About me

\toc

## Background

I grew up in Moscow, Russia. At 17 I moved to Boston to attend Boston University. My first academic interest was economics but I switched to math mid-way. In 2017 I spent a semester in Auckland, New Zealand, where I took my first proof based-math class. In 2019 I graduated from BU but stayed another year for a Masters degree in computer science, graduating in 2020. I started my PhD in pure math at the University of Washington in 2020, working on algebraic topology, but switched to applied math in 2022 after the first internship at Google. Since then I have worked on applications of deep learning and interacting particle systems to the Landau equation and to sampling.

I have a wide range of interests. In undergrad I worked stochastic simulation of jump processes with applications to mathematical biology. Then I spent three years learning algebra, algebraic topology, and category theory in grad school. When I switched to applied mathematics, I got interested in using interacting particle systems to numerically solve kinetic equations such as Fokker-Planck and Landau equations. In 2024 I got interested in mathematical underpinnings of deep learning, as well as its applications to practical problems such as sampling. Additionally, I have been working with the interactive proof assistant Lean, leading undergraduent research projects and a special topic course on Lean.

In my free time I do rock bouldering and calisthenics. I also like reading popular science books: some my favorites are "How to Hide an Empire" and "The Sixth Extinction." I use [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92514946-vasily) to keep track of books I have read and want to read.
